# CRC_CNN_Histopathology
Final Master Project by Jan Borr√†s Ros. The aim of this repository is to make the info about this project available to everyone.

This project uses the library downloaded from https://github.com/fastai/fastai and https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch. The scripts provided here need a proper installation of Fastai, PyTorch and all its dependencies as well as the Jupyter Notebook.

The paper is about to be released in the next month and it is going to be uploaded as soon as it becomes available.

You may download the images to train the CNN, install the dependencies and then run the script from a Jupyter Notebook session mounted inside of the fastai environment. Remember to point all the paths to the correct folders.
