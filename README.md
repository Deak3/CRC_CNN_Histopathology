# CRC_CNN_Histopathology

Final Master Project by Jan Borr√†s Ros. The aim of this repository is to make information about this project available to everyone.

This project use the frameworks FastAI (https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and PyTorch (https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) from Python. The scripts provided here need a proper installation of Fastai, PyTorch and all its dependencies. It is recommended that you use Jupyter Notebook to run the script.

You can find the final report here: http://openaccess.uoc.edu/webapps/o2/bitstream/10609/91366/3/jborrasrosTFM0119memoria.pdf (In catalan lenguage)

Download the images to train the CNN, install the dependencies and then run the script from a Jupyter Notebook session mounted inside of the fastai environment. Remember to point all paths to the correct folders.
